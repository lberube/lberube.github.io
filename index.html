    <h1> Welcome to my first webpage! </h1>
    <p> This is my first webpage and I am making it for CSC106. <br>
      It's really interesting to see the coding that goes behind things we take for granted in our every day life.<br>
      I'm really excited to learn more about coding. </p>
    <p> For this webpage I have created multiple images using pixlr. <br> 
      I have made a background, a banner, and Nav buttons. <br> 
      Each Nav button will lead to you another website. <br>
      I hope you enjoy using my webpage! </p>
