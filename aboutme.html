    <p> My name is Liliana Berube and I am currently going into my second year at the University of Rhode Island. I am studying physics <br>
      with a concentration on its application in medicine. I grew up on Block Island and am currently working there for the summer as I <br>
      take this course. I graduated from South Kingstown High School in 2018.</p>

    <p> I enjoy being in outside in nature, especially near the ocean <strong>no matter the season.</strong> I ran track throughout high school and am now the <br>
      vice president of the club track team at URI. My <em>favorite</em> event is pole vault, but it is currently not allowed at club track. I also <br>
      high jump, long jump, hurdle, and run the 4x100. </p>
