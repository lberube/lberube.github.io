    <p> My name is Liliana Berube and I am currently going into my second year at the University of Rhode Island. <br>
    I am studying physics with a concentration on its application in medicine. I grew up on Block Island and am <br>
    currently working there for the summer as I take this course. I graduated from South Kingstown High School <br>
    in 2018.</p>

    <p> I enjoy being in outside in nature, especially near the ocean no matter the season. I ran track throughout <br>
      high school and am now the vice president of the club track team at URI. My favorite event is pole vault, <br>
      but it is currently not allowed at club track. I also high jump, long jump, hurdle, and run the 4x100. </p>
